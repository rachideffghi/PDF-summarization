## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots showcasing the output of our application when provided with a research paper: Anshari, M. et al. (2019) ‘Customer relationship management and big data enabled:
Personalization & customization of services’, Applied Computing and Informatics, 15(2), pp. 94–101. doi:10.1016/j.aci.2018.05.004. 

### Word Cloud

The frequent references to "customer" and "data" in the text suggest a significant emphasis on the analysis of customer data within the research paper. Additionally, the repeated use of terms such as "CRM," "business," "service," and "marketing" indicates that the paper delves into the exploration of how these concepts can be harnessed to enhance overall business performance.

### Summary
